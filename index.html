                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>As long as I can remember, I’ve been fascinated with human behavior. My siblings can attest to the numerous behavioral experiments I ran!  My official career began 18 years ago as the program director of a psychiatric ward.  It was here I learned to appreciate the importance of early intervention and eventually steered my career towards working in schools and leading behavioral units.</p>

                        <p>I now live in the Salt Lake City area, supporting schools all over the state &mdash; Even going as far as Saint George and Rich county. For over 12 years, I’ve worked as a compliance specialist in coaching &amp; mentoring new teachers as well as helping administrations run their special education teams. My strength is compliance and my passion is behavior, but more importantly I just love supporting schools.</p>
