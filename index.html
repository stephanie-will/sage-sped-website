                        <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>I’ve made my home base in Salt Lake City, Utah after going to University.  My journey into tech started with a degree in marine biology.  As I started to write about my marine journey, I became very interested in blogging and then discovered how fascinated I was with web design and user experience. I was hooked and wanted to learn more about coding. </p>

                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>That curiosity opened a door that could never be shut.  When I learned how to build my first website I realized I found something that satisfied my analytical science brain and my creative, artsy brain.  Now I’m currently taking more classes to move into front-development and user experience where I can use my organization skills and eye for beauty to design clean, elegant code.</p>
